### What is Deep Learning

1.1 Artificial Intelligent, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
Relation: AI > ML > DL (>: Include)
1.1.1 AI
Intro: AI was born in the 1950s. Professions usually believed that once we have more specific rules to deal with the knowledge, the machine could be smart as human. We call it Symbolic AI. In the 1980s, the Expert System became the most popular. The symbolic AI can deal with problems that have clear logic, like playing chess. However, it did not work well with more complex issues, vague questions like image classification, voice recgonization. A new way to replace the symbolic ai was appear -- Machine Learning

1.1.2 ML
Intro: Analytical Engine, Turing Test...  Rules + Data = Answers; Data + Answers = Rules

1.1.3 Learn from Data
Hypothesis Space

1.1.4 Deep
Layer; Depth; Layered Representations Learning; Hierarchical Representations Learning; Shallow Learning; Neural Network;

1.1.5 Working Principles
Weight; Parameterize; Parameter; Loss Function; Objective Function; Optimizer; Backrpopagation; Training Loop;

1.2.6 
1.2.7 Most Popular Methods in 2017: Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBoost); Keras;
1.3 Why DL? Why Now?
LSTM created at 1997, why success in 2012? Hardware; Data Set; Algorism Improvement: Activation Funcion; Weight-Initialization Scheme; Optimization Scheme;
1.3.5 Theano & TensorFlow are symbolic tensor calculation framework based on python;

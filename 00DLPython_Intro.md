### Deep Learning with Python
Author: Francois Chollet
	-The founder of Keras, contributor of TensorFlow, trainer of Kaggle
Translator: Hysic Zhangliang
Abstract: This book use python and Keras to explore the best practice of deep learning in terms of computer vision, natural language, generator model and so on. After learning, audience be able to build their own deep learning training environment, to build image recgonization model, text and image generator model and so on. Suitable for professions who works at big data and machine learning area, and people who insterest.
